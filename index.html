                        I believe that all problems are eventually solvable through technology without introducing any additional externality. Technology evolves‚Äîgradually or rapidly‚Äîto match the complexity of problems. Today‚Äôs flawed solutions will never capture how easily these problems may be resolved in the future.<br><br>

                        Technology emerges from the interactions between intelligent entities and the universe they inhabit, while intelligence improves and evolves through technology. Technology is not only an external manifestation of intelligence but it stands as the ultimate culmination.<br><br>

                        Intelligence is the meta-problem underlying all challenges. Once intelligence is solved, we indirectly unlock solutions to every problem. The acceleration of ASI injects a second-order surge into all frontier sciences and engineering, placing us at an inflection point where the future will be unrecognizably better.<br><br>

                        The exponential growth of compute power, digital data & artifacts, and nn-based AI signals a broad intelligence revolution in both scale and depth.<br><br>

                        Technology has also been historically proven to be the only robust, consistent, and effective means to combat various social disparities, both directly and indirectly.<br><br>

                        Acceleration follows an exponential curve while human imagination remains confined to linear velocity. A fundamental transformation may be daunting, yet it is equally if not more exhilarating, for the only way forward is <span class="eater-regular text-xl">into the unknown</span>.

                        First stepping into a new field and learning tangible things is exciting and satisfying. This is especially true for programming. The basic realization became‚Äîhuh, I can just build things.<br><br>

                        I chose the book <span class="italic font-semibold">Python Crash Course</span> as a no-brainer and I still remember the Alien Invasion game made with pygame and the Learning Log with Django (although I started a new app called Book Share using everything I'd already learned in Learning Log and pushed so much further than what I knew), as I‚Äôm certain many people who started Python with this book do.<br><br>

                        Programming is only a subdomain of computer science, and a programming language itself can be tedious. So I have learned the basics and intermediate Python, the immediate question that hit me was‚Äîwhat do I use it for?

                        You remember that famous TV show Person of Interest? The iconic starting line was <span class="italic">"You are being watched. ‚Ä¶ A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. ‚Ä¶ I know, because I built it"</span>. I was fascinated about that show, and it drove me down a rabbit hole of research into artificial intelligence and the state of the art (at the time of course). Interestingly the show depicted the machine as completely hard-coded by Harold while real AI systems are neural net based models. I didn't know this distinction until later :)<br><br>

                        It was around the same time that a thing called "GPT" came out of nowhere (GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 small scale beta testing had already made its name) and started to create some real buzz.<br><br>

                        I knew absolutely nothing about AI, machine learning, and deep learning at the time. Zero. From an initial toe dipping, I realized learning AI required tremendous amount of understanding in math and quite sophisticated coding skills. I wasn‚Äôt sure I was up for it, but I decided to give it a try. That decision has led me such a long way here in retrospect.

                        I was starting to get a rhythm on diving into something entirely new. So again I started with the basics‚Äîneural network. I soon realized it was not as difficult as I had imagined it to be to at least get started on, because I had already had foundations on calculus and statistics, and "that thing" called linear algebra which I had painfully learned as a mandatory class in undergrad without knowing what the heck it was for, suddenly became unbelievably important. I quickly absorbed concepts like backpropagation and gradient descent, and fundamentals on MLP, CNN, RNN, and RL (didn‚Äôt pay Attention to transformer‚Äîpun intended‚Äîuntil later sadly). <br><br>

                        Soon I moved to building practical and fun small projects following tutorials using, you guessed it, Keras. I built and trained a super simple chatbot using just MLP in one-hot encoding with a lengthy pre-written dialogue json (it looks utterly laughable now compared to transformer based LLMs but I had so much fun building it). I also built and trained a dog/cat image detection model with CNN among other things, as it is sorta like the rite of passage for all deep learning beginners :) <br><br>

                        But finally something big caught my attention, and it‚Äôs called <span class="italic font-semibold">Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out</span> from the legend Andrej Karpathy! The first 10 mins in I quit, because I hadn‚Äôt even learned PyTorch yet :( I quickly did a PyTorch crash course, and I realized that I actually needed to learn to manipulate tensors in really granular ways instead of just stacking prebuilt layers like in Keras. After the quick PyTorch course, this time I didn‚Äôt directly jump into building GPT, but started from the first video tutorial in Karpathy‚Äôs channel and started intensively absorbing pure knowledge and brilliance, until finally I got to the super fun bonus part. <br><br>

                        I followed along every step in his building GPT video, doing side research whenever I saw something I didn‚Äôt understand, including reading <span class="italic font-semibold">Attention Is All You Need</span> paper dozens of times repeatedly, with each time getting just a bit more clarity. And finally, model was built and trained, I was able to see the tokens being generated one by one, and that was a magical moment.<br><br>

                        Later I reviewed everything I learned from the mini-GPT dev and I pre-trained a GPT-like (100M Params) LLM from scratch using a portion of the Common Crawl dataset, and further finetuned it with some instruction datasets I could find at the time. The model achieved above 20 on Hellaswag.

                        Today I don‚Äôt even remember how it started, but somehow I decided to learn Blender. I tend to think it is because 3D modeling and rendering is another epitome for the phrase "you can just build things". And the exhilaration you get from creating something beautiful out of thin air is beyond words.<br><br>

                        Building 3D models can be extremely time-consuming, EXTREMELY! But I enjoyed every minute of it. Seeing what you are building becoming just a bit more perfect is satisfying to say the least. During my learning in a few months, I made some beautiful rendered scenes and animations into final videos, and I would lay down sound tracks for them to make them even more cinematic. Considering I did all these on my old gaming laptop with an outdated GPU (even at the time), I am really happy I was able to make these! I selected some of them which I really like and threaded them into a video cut.

                        Oh, forgot to mention along with Blender, I also started to learn some game dev inside Unity. I made a few simple but interesting games.<br><br>

                        As I was having fun making game projects, I came across a library developed by the Unity team called ML-Agents. This framework allows you to develop and train robotic agents with RL in a virtual world inside the Unity game engine, sorta like a simpler version of Nvidia‚Äôs Isaac Sim. This became a perfect crossover project between Blender, Unity, and ML for me.<br><br>
                        
                        I used Blender to develop a 3D car model, exported it to Unity, and built a convoluted tunnel scene with the car being the agent, navigating out of the tunnel via RL learned self driving. After weeks of painstaking adjustments on reward functions (in C#) and hyperparameters, and countless training failures, finally I successfully trained an agent capable of steering the car out of the tunnel autonomously.

                        Going to a different country for a Masters study is a big change. I was excited to learn about business, and most importantly, to learn life in a different speed and spectrum.<br><br>

                        In the meantime, I went into a little bit of a tech certificate phase. Did a full Harvard CS50 class, cloud certificates from Azure and AWS, as well as some advance AI engineering classes.<br><br>
                        
                        But eventually, I realized that the best way to learn is after all project building. When you build, you‚Äôre forced to think about things from first principles, and you‚Äôre forced to go through every technical detail physically instead of just sweeping them by in your mind, which makes you learn every part of the tech stack.

                       Making apps that solve a little but practical problem is recreational and good for the soul.<br><br>

                       You have a vacation idea, I turn it into a travel plan. I wrote this project in Python only, leveraging OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (a bit deal at the time if you remember) API as the underlying LLM for validating and generating travel plans, as well as parsing locational information. Then it uses Google Maps API to find locations and plan optimal routes. Lastly, it generates an interactive map to display planned stops and routes in the travel plan.<br><br>

                       Transcrilate was the first sorta serious node.js project in React. It can transcribe English speech and translate it into 19 most common languages. The transcription and translation are separately handled by open models via HuggingFace transformers, both running inference locally.<br><br>

                       Gradually I have gotten into the habit of reading frontier AI research papers. Every morning one of the first things I do is check the Hugging Face Daily Papers section for interesting papers, and of course not all of them would make it to HF, and so ùïè is my paper hunting safety net. Reading raw AI papers forces me to constantly replenish my knowledge pool. Luckily there are tools like Claude and NotebookLM that make this process easier for me.

                    Now I'm buried by countless AI papers on arXiv and bombarded with AI/Tech development news on ùïè on a daily basis. Although I never stopped making more useful apps both for practical use, keeping skills sharp, and for some fun, only I've been taking them even further and exploring actually deploying the app, CI/CD, taking in user feedback for continuous improvements, as well as getting more users.<br><br> 

                    I never had a CS degree (except if you count Harvard CS50), and I am not a professional engineer. But what you can never take away from me is my starving hunger for learning. I love this Naval tweet, I'd like to think I'm a smart person, and there is immense joy for me in self learning interesting and useful new things. I will never stop learning.<br><br>

In fact, this is my <span class="font-semibold">litmus test</span> for people‚Äìyou can disagree with his political opinions all you want, but if you‚Äôd go as far as writing off all his achievements solely based on his political opinions, I know we are not the same people.<br><br>

                        He always goes to first principles when faced with extraordinarily complex problems. This is what makes him such a visionary and problem solver. He works constantly, learns constantly, and inspires people constantly. He perceives a goal, sets a course, and pursues it persistently on the order of decades. Nvidia‚Äôs success is not a fluke, it is a group of people guided by a wise and consistent man to position around the apple tree so they would be the closest to pick them up when the apples fall.<br><br>

                        My life was not the same after I was introduced with <span class="font-semibold italic">The Almanack of Naval Ravicant</span>. Life is a willful journey. If you go through your life just doing things without giving them much thought, you are just a group of molecules drifting where the universe takes you.<br><br>

                        Of all the wisdom from Naval on wealth, health, and happiness, what I get from him the most is self reflection and the urge to listen to my heart. The key is to be unapologetically proactive on who you really are.

                        Andrej Karpathy‚Äôs tutorials on neural networks and Transformer are one of the major reasons why I‚Äôve become so obsessed with AI, and certainly the biggest reason why I was able to advance from surface impressions to deeper technical understanding as an absolute beginner. I also know for a fact that this goes for most new AI enthusiasts like me in the past few years. And before that, his class CS231n at Stanford was a source of inspiration and knowledge for many computer vision talents.<br><br>

                        I am glad Andrej decided to go all in on democratizing AI education after his journey at OpenAI and Tesla, which God knows people now and in the future desperately need. He is a phenomenal educator and just one of the most brilliant minds out there.
